# Environment variables

If you want to set environment variables instead of modifying the config.yml, you can do so. The environment variable names are the same than the config.yml, except capitalized. So, TVHEADEND_URL and TUNER_COUNT.

Optionally, for private Docker networks that need to expose a different URL for the streams, you can specify a public stream URL using TVHEADEND_STREAM_URL
